### Problem Statement

Airbnb has high market share on the online marketplace industry for short-term homestays, and has revolutionised the tourism industry.
In Singapore, short-term home rentals of less than 3 months are illegal, due to the rise of home rents.
Nevertheless, for long-term stays, finding out the rental price of their house in AirBNB proofs to be beneficial, as too high of a price can deter customers.
Finding out the exact price can benefit both the Airbnb company, and the houseowners.
Due to regulations, Airbnb do not predict prices for houses in Singapore.
Hence, the problem statement would be if we can predict a good rental prices of a house for AirBNB given its location, room type, property type etc?
